# Introduction

The Payment API is a toolkit that provides card payment options for applications,
with which anyone can convert leads from ShopRenter more quickly. One-time and recurring fee
payments can also be made with it, and the application also takes care of automatic invoicing
without the intervention of developers. In addition to the above functions, we also provide a graphical interface.
The financial statistics of each application are available here, as well as for what income
earned from the payments. We can also easily create payment plans
from here, which makes our work much easier in the case of recurring fee payments.
