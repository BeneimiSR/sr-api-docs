# Payment plan for recurring payments

It is essential to have payment plans for Recurring payments.
We can edit our payment plans on https://billing.shoprenter.hu/plans.
After logging in, you can see a list of our existing plans and add new ones.

Changing the price and name of the payment plan also affects existing subscriptions,
if one of the two data is changed, the next fee payment period for existing subscriptions is based on the new data.
