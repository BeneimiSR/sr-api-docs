# WebHook automation

Webhook is an automatic message from the webshop towards an external system, that may be triggered by events such as placing an order, changing of the order status, newsletter subscription, unsubscribing from a newsletter, or data modification of a newsletter subscriber.
With the help of [WebHook Resource](/api/webhook.md) we can create such automations via API. The type of data sent by webhooks can be XML or JSON. The external system can be an ERP or an invoicing system, but several additional uses are possible.

## Properties
[WebHook Resource](/api/webhook.md) has the below properties
- **label**: Serves the internal identification of the notification, the name entered here will not be visible in the message.
- **event**: The type of the selected event, which can be the following:
  - **Order_confirm**: We can send a message, that is triggered by an order. We can use this, for example, to ask customers on their opinions on the ordered products.
  - **order_status_change**: If we would like to inform customers or colleagues on the change of order status, it is recommended to use this option. And we can use this trigger event in the same way in connection with customer groups as well, when the status change of an order is followed by movement in the customer groups.
  - **newsletter_subscribe**: When a new subscription to the newsletter occurs.
  - **newsletter_unsubscribe**: When someone unsubscribes from the newsletter.
  - **newsletter_update_subscriber**: When someone changes their data used for newsletter subscription.
- **status**: Here we can enable or disable the notification. Values:
  - **0** - Disabled
  - **1** - Enabled
- **webHookParameters**: Parameters can be used to set the type or the url where the webhook should be sent. Parameters should be sent as an object stored in a batch.
  Parameters:
  - **type**: json or xml
  - **Url**
- **webHookDelay**: Delay can be used to set when the webhook notification is being sent after the triggering event. If this value is not specified, sending is immediate.
  Parameters:
  - **delay**: e.g.: 10
  - **delayUnit**: day or hour

Concrete example for a  JSON type POST request:
```json
{
    "label": "test webhook",
    "event": "order_confirm",
    "status": 1,
    "webHookParameters": [
        {
            "type": "json",
            "url": "http://shoprenter.hu"
        }
    ],
    "webHookDelay": [
        {
            "delay": 10,
            "delayUnit": "day"
        }
    ]
}
```
